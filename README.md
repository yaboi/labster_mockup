#Labster Redesign Notes
###Part of Liv.it Recruitment Test

The purpose of this document is to recap the notes taken during the wireframing portion of this mockup creation. Behind any good mockup is a great wireframe.  
  
**Goal:** Get teachers to sign up to use Labster for their class.  
**Target Audience:** Teachers, Administrators  
**Value Proposition:**
  - Main: Full lab experience at half the cost.  
  - Secondary: Increased student learning outcome by more than 70%  

**Conversion:**  
  - Short-term: Sign up for 30-day trial / Book online Demo  
  - Long-term: Buy package after 30-day trial  

**Navigation:** Free Trial, Sign In, Lab Catalog, Features  

**Taglines:**  
  - Labster’s virtual laboratories give you and your students full access to a lab from anywhere.  
  - Labster’s virtual laboratories give you and your students full access to a lab at a fraction of the cost.  
  - Labster’s virtual laboratories allow students to labs that are otherwise too expensive, time consuming, or dangerous to perform in a traditional lab.  
  
**Upgrades from Mockup to Prototype (Dev):**  
  - In-App animated gifs inside computer screen in ‘super hero’ section.  
  - Technology sniffer to show the user the device they’re on, instead of always showing a Mac. e.g. If a user is on a Mac, they’ll see a Macbook Pro; If a user is on a Chromebook, they’ll see a Chromebook; if a user is on a PC, they’ll see a PC.  
  - To try to increase conversion, the ONLY yellow on the page (pops out) is a call to action to our Conversion metrics.  
  - Design is mobile-first and A/B testable based on mockups (labster_lg_a & labster_lg_b)
